### ArcGIS API

Using ArcGIS API a map was created showing important points in my life and included:
<br>• Configured point symbology, popup formatting, and sceneView behavior
<br>• Zoom to feature points
<br>• Clustering effect with point symbols to improve visualization, and
<br>• A search bar that allows users to input a city name and zoom to that location on the map
